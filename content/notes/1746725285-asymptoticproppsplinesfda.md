title: Asymptotic properties of penalized splines for functional data
---

Paper: {{< cite "xiaoAsymptoticPropertiesPenalized2020" >}}


This authors derive the asymptotic properties of the mean and covariance P-splines estimators of the mean and covariance functions of functional datasets. In particular, they study the $L_2$ and uniform convergence of these estimators.




**Conclusion of the paper**: Convergence rates are minimax optimal for the mean function and are comparable to those using other smoothing methods for the covariance function.
