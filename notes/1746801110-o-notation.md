# Big O notation 

It describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends toward a particular value or infinity. One writes

$$f(x) = O(g(x)), \quad\text{as} x \rightarrow \infty.$$

<br>

In that case, we say that: $f(x)$ is of the order of $g(x)$. A characterization of that is 

$$\exists M > 0, \exists x_0 \in \mathbb{R} / \forall x \geq x_0, \left| f(x) \right| \leq M \left| g(x) \right|.$$
