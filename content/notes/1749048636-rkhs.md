title: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
---

Based on [this page](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/rkhs/).

## Kernel 

Roughly speaking, a kernel does only two things:

1. Projecting the objects into some vector space (possibly infinite dimensional);

2. Performing an inner product on those vectors.

Mathematically speaking, let $\mathcal{X}$ be a set of objects—it might be a scalar, a vector, a function, etc. A kernel $K$ is a **function**: $K: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $x_{1}, x_{2} \in \mathcal{X}$, $K(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \langle \phi(x_{1}), \phi(x_{2}) \rangle$.

Here, the function $\phi: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$ projects the object $x$ into some vector space $\mathcal{Y}$.

The implicit calculation of $K$ is refer to as the **kernel trick**.


## RKHS 

A reproducing kernel Hilbert space is some kind of {{< backlink "1749050887-hilbert-space" "Hilbert spaces" >}}. Elements of a RKHS are functions.

A RKHS is a Hilbert space of functions with a particular property: all {{< backlink "1749053168-evaluation-functional" "evaluation functionals" >}} are continuous. 

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Definition" >}}
A Hilbert space $(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space if, given any $x \in \mathcal{X}$, the evaluation functional for $x$, $\delta_x(f) \coloneqq f(x)$ is continuous, where $f \in \mathcal{H}$.
{{< /admonition >}}

Ok, so far, we have three different sets: $\mathcal{H}$, a set of functions, $\mathcal{X}$, a set of objects and $\mathbb{R}$, a set of scalars. We can define mappings between these different sets!

1. Each function $f \in \mathcal{H}$ defines a *unique* mapping between $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbb{R}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 f: \mathcal{X} & \to \mathbb{R} \\\\\\
  x & \mapsto c.
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Each object $x \in \mathcal{X}$ defines a mapping between $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ thanks to the evaluation functionals:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \delta_x: \mathcal{H} & \to \mathbb{R} \\\\\\
            f & \mapsto c.
\end{aligned}
$$

There is one property that differentiates RKHS from an arbitrary Hilbert space: for each object $x \in \mathcal{X}$, the evaluation functional $\delta_x$ is continuous. 

To understand this property, we can view the set $\mathcal{H}$ as some *dense* space in some infinite-dimensional function space. It is possible to approximate any function in $\mathcal{H}$ arbitrarily well. For some fixed $x \in \mathcal{X}$, their exists a *smooth* surface where lies $\delta_x$—here, "smooth" emphasizes the continuity of the evaluation functional. Thus, two functions that are close to each other in $\mathcal{H}$ will be mapped to two similar values by $\delta_x$. 

From the definition, we have another property of RKHS. If we have a sequence of functions $f_{1}, f_{2}, \dots$ in $\mathcal{H}$ that converge to a function $f$ in $\mathcal{H}$, then these functions converge *pointwise* to $f$. It can be written mathematically as

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left\\| f_n - f \right\\|_{\mathcal{H}} = 0 \Rightarrow \forall x \in \mathcal{X}, \lim\_{n \to \infty} \left| f_n(x) - f(x) \right| = 0.$$
