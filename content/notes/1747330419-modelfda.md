title: A model for functional data
---

Suppose we observe $N$ realizations of a stochastic process $X$. Each of the realization is observed on a different set of sampling points. 

The observed data have the form $\\{ T_{i j}, Y_{i j} \in \mathcal{T} \times \mathbb{R}, 1 \leq j \leq M_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq N \\}$. The set $\mathcal{T}$ is a compact set. 

Note that, usually, in functional data analysis, fixed and random designs are considered for the sampling points. The number of points per curve, $M_i$ can also be random or not.

A general functional data model is given by:
$$Y_{i j} = \mu(T_{i j}) + X_{i}(T_{i j}) + \epsilon_{i j},$$
where

* $\mu$ is the mean function;

* $X_{i}$ is a zero-mean random function that model the $i$th observation (smooth deviation from the mean);

* $\epsilon_{i j}$ is the random error of the sampling points $T_{i j}$.

We denote by $C(s, t) = \text{Cov}(X(s), X(t))$ the covariance function of the random functions and $\sigma^2_{\epsilon} = \mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{i j}^2]$ the variance of the error.
