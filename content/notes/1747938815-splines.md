In the literature, spline fitting is referred under different terminology. Consider the data $(Y_{i}, X_i)$, the underlying model is 
$$Y_{i} = f(X_{i}) + \epsilon_i.$$

The idea of spline smoothing with B-spline basis functions concerns the minimization of the following quantity:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left[ Y_{i} - f(X_{i}) \right]^2 + \lambda J(f).$$

The function $f$ is set to be the elements of the B-spline basis.

## Regression splines 

Regression splines refer to the case where $\lambda = 0$.

## Smoothing splines

Smoothing splines refer to the case where
$$J(f) = \int f^{(m)}(x)^2 dx,$$
where $m$ is the order of the derivative of the splines. The most common choice is $m = 2$, leading to **cubic smoothing splines**.

## Penalized splines (P-splines)

P-splines refer to the case where 
$$J(\theta) = \theta^\top P \theta.$$
The matrix $\theta^\top P \theta$ corresponds to the square sum of the $d$th order consecutive differences of the coefficient vector $\theta$.
