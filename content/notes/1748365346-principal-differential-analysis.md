The idea of Principal Differential Analysis (PDA) is to describe the relationship between a sample of functions and their derivatives thanks to a time-varying linear ODE. 

## PDA as a data-reduction technique

Once the ODE has been estimated, we can used its $m$ linearly independent solutions as basis functions. This provides a low-dimensional representation of the observed functional data.
